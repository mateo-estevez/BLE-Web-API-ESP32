# BLE-Web-API-ESP32

This BLE Web API was developed in order to connect an ESP32 working as an automatic irrigation system along with some temperature and humidity sensors. The original project that inspired this API was developed by github user ruisantosdotme (please visit this [random nerd tutorials page](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-bluetooth/) if you're interested in learning how this project was made).
